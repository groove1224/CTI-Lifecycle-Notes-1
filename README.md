# Reconciling 3 Models of the Cyber Threat Intelligence Lifecycle

Bottom Line, Up Front:

(1) I need to get better at drawing on tablets,

(2) Learning different perspectives on the same topic facilitates improvement, and…

(3) Intelligence Lifecycle doesn’t begin with requirements – it begins with building relationships that lead to clarity on requirements to kickstart the process which leads back to further relationship-building for:

(a) feedback,

(b) optimization of process for…

(c) higher quality work product, and…

(d) ensuring the “so what” aspect of CTI efforts are leading to the delivery of impactful, meaningful value.

## Situation:

Three reputable, noteworthy sources – each with extensive discipline in the field of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) – have published their take on the CTI Lifecycle.

Which one is correct?

Which one will facilitate greater results for the practitioner and, ultimately, the organization?

## Discussion:

Below is an image with the three various models – and noted sources – found for the CTI Lifecycle.

On review, three aspects are of prima facia interest:

### (a) The amount of steps in each lifecycle manifestation.

Let’s compare –

### (b) Implications

Recorded Future and Gary Ruddell make a clear distinction on the need to receive guidance on the requirements for the organization.

Chris Cochran chooses language that departs from the status quo to suggest more engagement vice the suggestion of “taking direction” (granted exclusively by the chosen word: Direction).

By no means is this to suggest that Recorded Future and/or Gary Ruddell take the position that intelligence requirements are given instead of discussed in two-way dialogue – between the CTI practitioner and the stakeholder(s) that will ultimately
receive the intelligence work products going forward. (For the sake of clarity, I have never once heard, nor read, any such claim by Recorded Future and/or Gary Ruddell; the statements above merely reflect that I do not know their position on stage one of their respective models.)

Further, while Gary Ruddell and Chris Cochran reflected an intelligence lifecycle model that range in a left-to-right comparison of not explicitly stating specific steps in their respective models, it is extremely likely that the steps not written or spoken explicitly – thus shortening their models from 6 steps in listed format – still exist within their respective, published models.

Having investigated each sources’ work further, it is clear that each model agrees on the following:

+ Intelligence requirements begin with the client/stakeholder.

+ Collection is essential, as is processing data into information for meaningful analysis.

+ Someone will ultimately receive the intelligence output – and it is hoped that the product will be of significant value, help, and maximum use to those receiving said product.

+ In each model returning to a requirement stage, it is imperative that the CTI professional proactively discover the outcomes of their efforts.

### (c) Impressions

I was impressed by the baked-in implication – not stated in the section above merely for the sake of allowing it to be the kickoff point of this section – that it is on the onus of the
CTI practitioner to actively pursue the following:

+ Learn of the effectiveness of the work produced

+ Seek out feedback, including confirmation of whether or not the efforts made a difference, whether the needs of the stakeholder/audience of the CTI work product may have adjusted, and even whether to modify the delivery of the work product (such as electronic delivery, deliver-by-hand, scheduled in-person or video conference presentation, etc.).

+ Optimize the sources of collection for:

  + (i.) scope,
  + (ii.) reliability,
  + (iii.) cost,
  + (iv.) value dreived, and even...
  + (v.) whether a source ought to be let go of

+ Improve in their ability to deliver the intelligence in a helpful way – which could range from telling a story to relating the information to that which is of interest to the intended audience (even the stakeholder).

## Conclusion:
