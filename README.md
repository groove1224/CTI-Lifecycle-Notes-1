# Reconciling 3 Models of the Cyber Threat Intelligence Lifecycle

Bottom Line, Up Front:

(1) I need to get better at drawing on tablets,

(2) Learning different perspectives on the same topic facilitates improvement, and…

(3) Intelligence Lifecycle doesn’t begin with requirements – it begins with building relationships that lead to clarity on requirements to kickstart the process which leads back to further relationship-building for:

(a) feedback,

(b) optimization of process for…

(c) higher quality work product, and…

(d) ensuring the “so what” aspect of CTI efforts are leading to the delivery of impactful, meaningful value.

## Situation:

Three reputable, noteworthy sources – each with extensive discipline in the field of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) – have published their take on the CTI Lifecycle.

Which one is correct?

Which one will facilitate greater results for the practitioner and, ultimately, the organization?

## Discussion:

Below is an image with the three various models – and noted sources – found for the CTI Lifecycle.

On review, three aspects are of prima facia interest:

### (a) The amount of steps in each lifecycle manifestation.

Let’s compare –

### (b) Implications

Recorded Future and Gary Ruddell make a clear distinction on the need to receive guidance on the requirements for the organization.

Chris Cochran chooses language that departs from the status quo to suggest more engagement vice the suggestion of “taking direction” (granted exclusively by the chosen word: Direction).

By no means is this to suggest that Recorded Future and/or Gary Ruddell take the position that intelligence requirements are given instead of discussed in two-way dialogue – between the CTI practitioner and the stakeholder(s) that will ultimately
receive the intelligence work products going forward. (For the sake of clarity, I have never once heard, nor read, any such claim by Recorded Future and/or Gary Ruddell; the statements above merely reflect that I do not know their position on stage one of their respective models.)

Further, while Gary Ruddell and Chris Cochran reflected an intelligence lifecycle model that range in a left-to-right comparison of not explicitly stating specific steps in their respective models, it is extremely likely that the steps not written or spoken explicitly – thus shortening their models from 6 steps in listed format – still exist within their respective, published models.

## Conclusion:
